# Numberless-2048
Thing #1 for learning my way around Monogame this winter break: a 2048-like game with colorful tiles.


##### NOTE: Game is playable, but not complete. 
Currently there are no posted instructions or score, and the project and game window are still named "Thing 1". However, all the logic and mechanics are there, so play away!

**Update 9/30/17:** There is now a score and basic playername entering at the start of the game. The score, time/date, and name are saved in a file at the end. Next I will work on posting high scores at the end of the game, and possibly in the top corner during the game as well.

##### How to Run
Run setup.exe in Thing1/Numberless-2048 to install the game. A shortcut will be created on the Desktop.

Update: This is not working, but feel free to try it.
