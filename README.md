# Numberless-2048
Thing #1 for learning my way around Monogame this winter break: a 2048-like game with colorful tiles.


##### NOTE: Game is playable, but not complete. 
Currently there are no posted instructions or score, and the project is still named "Thing 1". 

##### How to Install
Run setup.exe.
