# Numberless-2048
Thing #1 for learning my way around Monogame this winter break: a 2048-like game with colorful tiles.


##### NOTE: Game is playable, but not complete. 
Currently there are no posted instructions or score, and the project and game window are still named "Thing 1". However, all the logic and mechanics are there, so play away!

##### How to Run
Run setup.exe in Thing1/Numberless-2048 to install the game. A shortcut will be created on the Desktop.


I will finish up the game after I complete Thing 2 and Thing 3.
